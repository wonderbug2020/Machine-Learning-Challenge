After loading in the data my first step was to check all the column headers against their descriptions found at, https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html the exoplanet archive. After reviewing the columns I only eliminated the columns that seemed to be identifiers as opposed to data points.
Next, I noticed that my predictor column had 3 possible outputs. My initial reaction is that one of the variables, Candidates, was intended to be used for the final step of assigning priority for these candidates. This lead down a wild and informative side quest that ultimately resulted in me discovering the candidate rows should remain in place. 
I then began exploring the features and some simple feature engineering. I eventually discovered a good list of features and found that a random forest would be my best model. I used google colab to do most the grid search as it was time and resource intensive. Eventually I found using an optimized random tree gave me an accuracy of about 89%
